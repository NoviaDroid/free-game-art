Hello,

thanks for downloading the free tree game sprites. If you have any questions and/or requests, feel free to contact me via envato or e-mail (cgfawlogin@gmail.com).

The trees were painted by hand in Photoshop. This is what ýou get in this package:

- 1 PSD sheet with all the trees in different layers
- 8 single transparent PNG files each with a single tree
- this text file

I hope you enjoy using the sprites for your project!

Have a nice day
