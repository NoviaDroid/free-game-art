Hi Friends,
 
I am Sujit Yadav. I love game development. Many Indie game developers left their games because of no good game assets. So I thought to give away free game art. Every month, I post a game assets pack for Indie game developers on my website. I thought to create a topic here to post my monthly art packs. So more people can use them. The art packs are free for commercial use too. Credits are also not required but much appreciated. I hope you will like it. I will be updating this thread with the new sprite packs.
