== BUILDING THE FILES ==

The archive may contain a .spritedesc file that can be given
to Pack My Sprite in order to build the PNG and .spritepos
files. See http://www.stuff-o-matic.com/pack-my-sprites/ for
details.

== DONATIONS ==

The legislation in my country does not make it easy to receive
money without providing something in exchange. Thus, the best
way to support my work with money is to buy my game:

You can buy the game for any amount you want.
