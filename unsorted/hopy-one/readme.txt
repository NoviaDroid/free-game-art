The bio-droid, Hopy-ONE, was created in a laboratory Professor Jonathan Silt had set up in 2013 to research the F.L.V. (Fast Line Virus), the deadliest strain of mutating virus in the galaxy. Silt was infected and cryogenically frozen in 2026. Hopy-ONE's mission was to collect samples of the virus to aid in the production of a vaccine. The fate of Silt, who waits in cryosleep, and the fate of the entire universe, rests with Hopy-ONE.

Bio-droid Hopy-ONE must collect samples of the F.L.V. at each level before moving on to the next. On each level bio-droid may move left/right, stretch and jump by shrinking and releasing itself. Also bio-droid may shoot in horizontal plane to eliminate another droids moving and shooting on the level, and extend tentacles (also morph).
