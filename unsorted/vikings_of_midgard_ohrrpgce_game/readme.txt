Enormous set of high quality pixelart graphics, coming from Vikings of Midgard, which appears to be the best game made with OHRRPGCE engine and comes bundled with it. Includes everything one needs to make a JRPG.

Although the game's wiki page says that license is Public Domain, the readme file says it is GPL and the authors asks to be credited. So I assume the license is GPL.
