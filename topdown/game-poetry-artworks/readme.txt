We recently stopped production on an internal project over at Urbansquall. The game was an old school adventure game, the likes of King’s Quest and other Sierra masterpieces, except with a fake 3/4 zelda-like perspective. Rather than letting this pretty artwork waste away hidden on a rusty old hard drive, I thought someone out there might be able to use them, so please, help yourself.

If you decide to use any of these tilesheets, please let us know by dropping a comment here (though you certainly don’t have to). We’d love to see them find a home in a game somewhere. If you need some more in a matching style to finish your game, let us know as well and we might be able to take care of you.
