I put together some 2D art while  working on a personal game project called Ice Insignia (a Fire Emblem like game). I've since abandoned the project, but figured I'd upload some of the assets in case someone finds them useful.

I'm more of a programmer than an artist, but maybe these will serve as a nice starting point for a 2D RPG/Strategy game.

I used lotusware's pixel art tutorial  as a guide while creating the terrain.
