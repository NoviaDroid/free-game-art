"Big thanks to Coyotecraft from HBGames for having stashed most of this away.

Folks have been asking if I've got any of my old rpgmaker sprites and tilesets in one spot, and now I do.  Everything in this download is free for all use, but please don't redistribute - and always credit.  (redistribution of sprites is how we loose credits and things get attributed to the wrong people)  The things in the halfkaizer folder you should also credit ShowKaizer for the creation of the original template,  and the things in the Aveyond2 folder, credit Amaranth Games."


NOTE: I've tried my best to remove edited RMXP sprites, still a few could have remained. Notify me if you find some (snv@gmail.com).
