-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This typeface is what I like to call Distro-Ware. Which means you can do 
whatever ya want with the type-face with the sole exception or reselling it.
Use however ya wish on as many computers as ya wish and give it to as many 
people as ya wish  =) If you would like to include this font on your website
as a give-away feel free, as long as this documentation reamains with the font! 
thanks!
