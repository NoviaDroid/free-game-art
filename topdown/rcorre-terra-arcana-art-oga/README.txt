This art pack is compiled from an unfinished game of mine called "Terra Arcana". 
The game can be found at: https://github.com/rcorre/terra-arcana

All the art in this pack was made by me using the following programs:
Aseprite: http://www.aseprite.org/
Inkscape: https://inkscape.org/

The art is licensed under CC-BY 3.0: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/
Attribution can go to "rcorre" or "Ryan Roden-Corrent", and you can link to 
"https://github.com/rcorre/terra-arcana".

The art consists mostly of unit spritesheets, as well as one tileset and a few
gui elements (arrows and selectors for tiles).

Most unit spritesheets contain 5 rows of animation:
0. Idle
1. Action 1
2. Action 2
3. Action 1 Effect (to be played on the target of the action)
4. Action 2 Effect (to be played on the target of the action)

Unfortunately I did not have the foresight to make all animations the same
length, so they are somewhat inconsistent.

If you would like to modify the art, you might be interested in the .ase and
.svg files found in the resources/ directory of the project repo, as well as the
included color palette (palette.gpl).

Hope you find this useful; happy game-dev'ing!
