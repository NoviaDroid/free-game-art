This is the Liberated Pixel Cup art phase entry of Mark Weyer.
As per the requirement, everything is licensed under the GLPv3 (see file
LICENSE_gpl) and under the CC-BY-SAv3 (see file LICENSE_cc). Those files which
are under the sole copyright of Mark Weyer are furthermore licensed under the
OINMv0 (see file LICENSE_oinm).
This means that you may chose which of the two or three licenses you want to
apply to the respective file.

Some of the images were generated by programs and scripts. In those cases, the
source in the sense of the GPL and the OINM license is not the image itself!
Those images are canopy_*.png and mockup.gif.
They are precompiled in this archive, so recompiling would only be necessary
for modifications. Doing
  oinm mockup.gif canopy_south_shadow.png canopy_north_shadow.png canopy_west_shadow.png canopy_east_shadow.png
does the recompilation, assuming the right tools are installed, of which oinm
  (http://www.weyer-zuhause.de/mark/software/oinm_0.0.tgz)
is the least obvious.
The recompilation also requires some images from the LPC base assets. They are
not included in this archive lest the impression arises that I intend to claim
them for myself.

See file COMMENTS for further comments on the individual images.

See file CREDITS for detailed information of which images are based on which
prior work.
