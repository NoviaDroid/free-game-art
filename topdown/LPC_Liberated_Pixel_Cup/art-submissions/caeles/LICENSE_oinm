0 Definitions

0.1 This license applies to any work (hereafter called `The Work') which
    contains or is accompanied by a notice from the copyright holder or
    other authorized party (hereafter called `We') saying that the work is
    licensed under this license. Each licensee is hereafter called `You'.

0.2 A modified version of a work is any work based on the work. Examples of
    modified versions of a work include, but are not limited to, translations,
    adaptions, and improved versions of the work. A modification of a work is
    the difference between the work and a modified version of the work.

0.3 Source

0.3.1 A definition of a work is a collection of digital data from which the
      work can be produced by automated means.

0.3.2 A form of a work is a definition of the work which is, or has been at
      some time in the past, manifest.

0.3.3 The source of a work is any form of the work preferred for making
      modifications to the work and the form.

1 We grant You the right to use, distribute and modify The Work as well as
  Your modifications of The Work, provided the following conditions are met:

1.1 When You distribute any form of The Work which is not the source of The
    Work, You must also

1.1.1 accompany the distribution with the source of The Work on a medium
      customarily used for interchange of digital data, or

1.1.2 make the source of The Work available in the same way as The Work for no
      additional charge, or

1.1.3 give all recipients of The Work an offer, valid for at least five
      years, to distribute the source of The Work to them on a medium
      customarily used for interchange of digital data, for no charge or
      a charge no more than Your cost of performing such distribution.

1.2 You may only distribute a modified version of The Work, if the modified
    version retains all copyright notices, grants of this license, and
    disclaimers of warranty which pertain to the parts of The Work still
    present in the modified version.

1.3 When You distribute a modified version of The Work, You must license Your
    modifications under this license to all recipients. If such a modified
    version of The Work becomes part of a larger work, this condition refers
    only to that part of the larger work which is a modified version of
    The Work.

1.4 All above conditions regarding The Work are equally required for Your
    modifications of The Work.

2 We grant You the right to license your modifications of The Work to
  Mark Weyer (contribute@weyer-zuhause.de) under any license of your choice.

3 We grant You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicensable
  license, under patent claims owned or controlled by Us that are embodied in
  The Work as furnished by Us, for the duration of the patents, to make, use,
  sell, offer for sale, have made, and import The Work and modified versions
  of The Work.

4 By You distributing The Work, each recipient receives a license grant for
  The Work from Us under this license. By You distributing a modified version
  of The Work, each recipient receives such a license grant for that part of
  the modified work for which We have authority to do so.

5 NO WARRANTY, NO LIABILITY

5.1 There is no warranty for The Work, to the extent permitted by applicable
    law. Except when otherwise stated in writing We provide The Work "as is"
    without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but
    not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a
    particular purpose, and noninfringement. The entire risk as to the quality
    of The Work is with You. Should The Work prove defective, You assume the
    cost of all necessary servicing, repair or correction.

5.2 In no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing will
    We be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, general,
    special, incidental, exemplary, or consequential damages (including but
    not limited to loss of data or data being rendered inaccurate or losses
    sustained by You or third parties; procurement of substitute goods or
    services; loss of use, data, or profits; or business interruption) or any
    other claim or liability, whether in contract, strict liability, or tort
    (including negligence or otherwise), arising in any way from, out of or in
    connection with the use or inability to use or other dealing in The Work.

5.3 If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above
    cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing
    courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute
    waiver of all civil liability in connection with The Work, unless a
    warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of The Work in
    return for a fee.
