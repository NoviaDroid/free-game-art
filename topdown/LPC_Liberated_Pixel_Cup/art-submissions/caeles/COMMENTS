General:
--------
For versatility, I made some things work in eight directions, not just four.
According to the perspective of the base assets, the diagonal directions are
2:1, not 1:1.


birdbath.png:
-------------
Sorry, I couldn't resist. Behold the liberated pixel bird bath. I removed the
handles from the cup lest cats try to climb them.
Tiles 1,1-4,1 and 5,1-9,1 are a cyclic animation.


canopy_east.png:
----------------
This is for growing a leafy platform onto a platformtree. More precisely it is
for growing to the right.
The first column (width 96) is for extending an existing right-reaching branch.
The second (width 64) and third (width 96) column are for starting a branch
from a canopy seed.
Likewise, the following columns are for starting a branch from different
situations. The situations are, in order: A down-reaching branch which goes on,
an up-reaching branch which goes on, a seed which already has branches going
up and down, a down-reaching branch which ends at the starting point of the
growing branch, and an up-reaching branch which ends likewise.
These do not cover all situations, e.g. a seed already having branches going up
and left but not down. In general, the branch starting tile will have to be
subdivided into four 16x16 tiles.

canopy_north.png:
-----------------
Like canopy_east.png, but for branches growing up.
It is organized in rows, not columns, but the order of rows is the same as the
order of columns in canopy_east.png.
Effectively, this image has a tile size of 32x16.

canopy_south.png:
-----------------
Like canopy_north.png, but for branches growing down.

canopy_west.png:
-----------------
Like canopy_east.png, but for branches growing to the left.


leaves.png:
-----------
This is not intended for direct use. It is a source file of the canopy_*.png


platformtree.png:
-----------------
This is the trunk of the platform tree.
Use tile 0,0 at top, then a sequence of 0,2 and finally 0,3 (or 1,3 for a
small shadow) at the bottom. Canopy seed can be overlaid with 1,2 or 1,1 at the
top. Alternative canopy seeds from the canopy_*.png can be used like 1,1 even
in the middle of the trunk if 0,1 is overlaid afterwards. A top canopy seed
should be overlaid with 1,0.


signpost.png:
-------------
Obviosly, the tiles 0,0 and 0,1 are the pole and the remaining tiles give the
directions. If the signpost should have more than one arrow, use a vertical
offset of at least 9 pixels.

signpost_shadow.png:
--------------------
This file is separate from signpost.png, because signposts are an overlay of
different tiles, possibly with vertical offset. Only posts with 1 or two arrow
directions are supported. In row i and column j you have the shadow for a
signpost with directions i and j, where
0 is east
1 is southeast
2 is south
3 is southwest
4 is west
5 is northwest
6 is north
7 is northeast
consequently, single direction signpost shadows are on the diagonal.


vehicle_all.png:
----------------
Each row of the spritesheet represents one direction with 24 frames.
The first 8 frames are the "driving forward" animation.
The other frames are for turning. The idea is that the vehicle turns 45 degree
per frame, clockwise in columns 16-23 and counterclockwise in columns 8-15.
Of course, during such turning the row changes. The columns should be used
subsequently (modulo 8 that is) so that the engine runs on smoothly.
Frames are 64x96


water_attack.png:
-----------------
Firing to the right: You start with something small, like tile 0,0 next to
tile 15,1. Then you expand this to the left while moving it to the right at
the same speed. Stop expanding when shooting finishes. Once the stream hits
something, shorten it from the right at the same speed again (still moving).
Expanding to the right is what row 0 is for, shortening from the left is row 1.
Middle tiles are 15,0 or 0,1 (they are identical).
Firing to the left: The same, only backwards in time.
Firing in other direction: The same with other rows.


*_shadow.png:
-------------
Use like the respective non-shadow image.
The shadow is in a separate file for two reasons:
- So that the object's elevation is variable.
- I am not entirely sure these objects should have shadows at all.
