I modified Sharm's chests to animate them opening.

The weird gate thing is derived from Sharm's work as well and is animated too.

I made a top-hat on an recolored character made with the Universal LPC Sprite Sheet Character Generator, using Stephen Challener and Thane Brimhall's art.

I designed the keys and little glowing ball myself.
