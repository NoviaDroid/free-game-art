I made this specially for video game developers. 

Is not an alien but a simple template. There are 3 noses, 3 couple of eyes and 3 mouths per each template.

Hair, clothes, and other stuff will be in your hands.


Anyone is free to use it, sell it, edit it, and share with others.

I dont need credits, i just dont want selfish people that dont want to share things with others.


I hope that it can be useful to somebody.
