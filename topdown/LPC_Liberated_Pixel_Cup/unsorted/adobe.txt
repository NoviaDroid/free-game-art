I decided to extend Sharm/William.Thompsonj's LPC "Adobe Building set" (http://opengameart.org/content/lpc-adobe-building-set) with some additional tiles for archways, stairs, benches, awnings, and columns, to make it easier to make desert town scenes. I may extend with more tiles; let me know if you have ideas!
