Just a little beetle for the LPC.  It's all ready for formatting, but I honestly didn't want to finish it.  So yeah!  Enjoy.  There might be more monsters coming.  Note that it has walking animations plus attacking (two rightmost frames on each row).

 

edit: added a hole from which they might spawn per request.
