This is based on the LPC base assets and on the sand contributed by daneeklu, found here: http://opengameart.org/content/lpc-farming-tilesets-magic-animations-and...

I made this alternate color scheme because the sand contributed by daneeklu was way more yellow than I wanted. I tried to pick closer to real sand colors, hopefully it looks reasonable enough to use as-is. If it's not quite what you want feel free to drop a comment and I'll do my best to help out.

Added sand with cold water, deep water, ice, and rock.
