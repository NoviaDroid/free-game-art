This is a commissioned work by Sharm. I'm uploading it because I'm the one who paid the commission! These works are licensed to me but I give Sharm (Lanea Zimmerman) the right to handle and use this set as her own work since she was kind enough to give me a small discount for making it open and free for the public to use. Please use it and share with me when you do use it. If the license is a problem please contact me and we'll work something out between us.
