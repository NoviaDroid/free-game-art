This is an rpgmaker firendly tileset I made a while back for a game that never got finished. I thought I'd release it to the public. Fell free to use it in any of your games, even games you plan to sell. You owe me nothing maybe short of a free copy of your game when it is finished! Edit these, do whatever you want with them!

 

I'll be updating www.lorestrome.com with new tilesets in the future! I'll try to include new ones here as well when I release them. Go make games! :D
