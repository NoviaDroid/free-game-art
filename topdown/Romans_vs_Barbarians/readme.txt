Hi there,

I hope you like this game graphics pack!

they were created in 2007 by Felix Maiwald (http://felixmaiwald.com)
for a game project titled "The Ring War" in cooperation with Lukas Michiels.

I hope you find a use for the graphics.

If you want to recreate the look-and-feel of the graphics,
I used the program "The Gimp" and played around a lot with filters such as "Gimpressionist"

PLEASE let me know if you used these graphics in your project,
I would love to see them come alive somewhere!!
