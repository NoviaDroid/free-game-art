Conrad von Hötzendorf's Official Address, 14 June 1918

Soldiers!

For months and months, resisting victoriously amidst the glaciers and the snows, accomplishing faithfully your duty in the tempests of winter, you have looked down upon the sunny plain of Italy.
The time to go down into it has come.  Like a whirlwind, you will overthrow the false and perjured ally of the past, as well as the friends she has called to her help.  You will prove to the world that nobody can resist your heroism.
Your fathers, your grandfathers, and your ancestors, have fought and conquered the same enemy with the same spirit.
I am sure you will not fall below them, and even that you will rise above them.  Heart and soul with you, I shall follow your movements, which will be an irresistible rush towards victory.
Confiding firmly in you, I cry to you: "Overthrow everything before you."

Conrad wrote these words one day before the last Austro-Hungarian offensive of the Great War. This ill-fated attack paved the way for the total destruction of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the fall of the 600-year-old Habsburg rule. In this campaign for Panzer General (DOS) you can actually win this battle along with others and preserve the unity of the nations of the Empire for the rest of the 20th century. However, it will not be an easy task, as it is often said that Austria-Hungary had one of the weakest armies of the Great War. On the one hand, it is true that the k. u. k. (kaiserlich und königlich - Imperial and Royal) Army was hardly able to win a single battle without German support and it also suffered extremely high casualties in the war. But, on the other hand, it is also true that it had to fight on three different theatres simultaneously against an enemy that outnumbered it 2 to 1, desperately trying to keep discipline among soldiers of a dozen different nationalities. And still, this despised army, aided by its allies, was able to defeat most of its enemies and never gave up the chance to win the war for the Emperor.

By the start of the 20th century a new system of alliances was formed in Europe. The Entente,  or 'friendly understanding', was the alliance of France, Britain, and Russia. It opposed the Triple Alliance of Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy. This alliance had to be renewed in every five years and was first signed in 1882. Although, Austria-Hungary and Italy were formally allies, both had interests on the Balkans, especially in Dalmatia, and in Tyrol. These lands were possessed by the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and Italian claims finally led to the Italian declaration of war in 1915. From this act one can only speak about the Dual Alliance of Germany and Austria-Hungary. Bulgaria and the Turkish Empire joined this alliance as well, and the members of this Quadruple Alliance are also known as the Central Powers. Austria-Hungary also had a disagreement with Serbia. Serbia wanted to unify all Serbs on the Balkans in their country, including those who lived in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which was occupied by the Monarchy. When Austria-Hungary annexed this territory in 1908, war was only hardly avoided. However, the relationship of the two countries was spoiled permanently. In Serbia secret organizations were formed against Austria. In the Balkan wars of 1912 and 1913 Serbia was strengthened both politically and economically. A sparkle was enough for the explosion. When Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, was assassinated in Sarajevo by a group of young nationalists, Serbia was the first to blamed. Although the responsibility of the 'official' Serbia was not proved, many believed that Serbia had some role in the attempt. One month later an unacceptable ultimatum was sent which was (partially) refused. Following the Austrian declaration of war, Russia also started mobilizing his army in defense of Serbia. A chain of declarations of war was started and within a few days most of Europe was in fire.

In 1914, the Austro-Hungarian General Staff had three mobilization plans for the upcoming war:

- Plan 'R' (Russland) 40 infantry divisions along with the promised 13 German divisions act offensively in Russia, 9 infantry divisions protect the Serbian border,

- Plan 'I' (Italia) 40 infantry divisions act offensively in Italy, 9 infantry divisions protect the Serbian border,

- Plan 'B' (Balkan) 20 infantry divisions act offensively in Serbia, 29 infantry divisions protect the Russian border.

(Note that there was no plan for a situation in which the Monarchy had to fight on all three theatres at the same time, what exactly happened in 1915.)

It was largely up to the politicians to decide which one to choose, but during the last days of July 1914, they believed that Russia will not mobilize just to defend little Serbia. As a result, on 28 July plan 'B' (Balkan) was chosen as a restricted war against Serbia alone. When news of the Russian mobilization arrived on 31 July, it was quickly changed to plan 'R' (Russland) to precede the Russian attack. The result was disastrous. At a time when a surprise attack was a necessity many units were somewhere halfway between Galizia and the Balkans in total confusion. There were neither enough forces in Galizia nor in the Balkans when the offensives were started and enemy resistance was also stronger than estimated. The k. u. k. Army suffered its first defeats, which were followed by others, losing many young soldiers in the first months of the war. They had to be replaced by working class middle-aged men, which weakened the economy and the agriculture on the long run.


The k.u.k. Army

I got a letter from the government the other day
I opened it and read it said they were suckers
They wanted me for the Army or whatever
Picture me, givin' a damn - I said NEVER

Tricky


The so-called Dual Monarchy of Austria and Hungary, from 1867 onwards, consisted of two equal parts, the Austrian Empire and the Hungarian Kingdom. It was ruled by one single person, Franz Joseph I, who was the Emperor of Austria and the King of Hungary as well. The old Emperor and King was ruling since 1848. Austria and Hungary had her own parliament, ministries, government, and juridical system, but there were some common ministries as well: the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Finance and, most importantly, the Ministry of War. These were led by common representatives. The importance of equality was emphasized in all forums, which guaranteed the stability of the Monarchy. For example, when the new arms of the Empire was shown in 1915 (which you can see on page 1.), Hungarian Members of the Parliament were complaining that the Austrian crown was a bit taller than the Hungarian and they requested that it should be just as tall as the Hungarian.

Besides the two favored nationalities there were several other (Slavic) nationalities in the Empire. As a result of the restricted election system Austrians and Hungarians were over-represented in the two parliaments, though. From the early 20th century Slavic nationalities started demanding equal rights and more freedom. These were rejected by both the Austrians and Hungarians. As the world war progressed more and more Slavs started to think that the real enemies are Austrians and Hungarians and not the Entente. On October 16, 1918 the new Emperor and King, Karl I (Karl IV of Hungary) issued his manifesto to transform the Monarchy to a 'Federation of Independent States', but it was just too late. The war was lost and Austria-Hungary was completely destroyed. For long decades the nations of the former Empire viewed each other suspiciously. After 86 years (interestingly Franz Joseph was 86 when he died) in 2004, most of these nations joined each other again in the EU. Hopefully, in a few years all these nations will be parts of the same European power again. In a few years they will use a common currency again and they will introduce the same standardized laws again. And, possibly, some years later there will be a common army again. The Emperor would be pleased.


The Infantry

The Austro-Hungarian Army was as complex as the Empire itself as it composed of three separate armies. The largest was the common or k. u. k. Army, which was maintained by the common Ministry of War and was recruited from both parts of the Empire. Additionally, Austria and Hungary had their separate standing armies as well. While the Austrian Landwehr (standard infantry) and Landsturm (poorly equipped second levy infantry) regiments were recruited from the Austrian provinces and the commanding language was German, the Hungarian Honvéd (defense forces) and Népfelkelõ (second levy territorial army) regiments were recruited from Hungary and Croatia and the commanding language was usually Hungarian. Naturally these armies fought side by side in the war under the common red and white flag.

The k. u. k. Army was also a mixture of the different nationalities living in the two parts of the Empire. Although, Austrians and Hungarians were the two most populous nationalities, the other (Slavic) nationalities were in the majority.
From 100 Austro-Hungarian soldiers approximately:
- 25 were Austrian
	(or German)
- 23 were Hungarian
- 13 were Czech
- 8 were Polish
- 8 were Ukrainian
- 9 were Serb or Croatian
- 7 were Romanian
- 4 were Slovak
- 2 were Slovene
- 1 was Italian

(Note that these figures are only
estimates and not necessarily precise.)

The Artillery

In the First World War the majority of the combat losses were caused by direct or indirect artillery fire, so it is not surprising that artillery has a major importance in K. u. k. General. In 1914 the k. u. k. Army had some 3.500 light and 500 heavy (larger than 10cm caliber) artillery pieces (Germany: 8.000 light, 1.400 heavy, Russia: 6.800 light, 240 heavy, France: 4.000 light, 300 heavy). By 1918 these numbers increased to 6.700 and 1.550 (Germany: 12.000 light, 7.800 heavy). The lack of heavy artillery was realized early on by most armies. In the first year of the war the 'workhorse' of the Austro-Hungarian field artillery was the 8cm (light) M.1905/08 Field Gun, the standard 10cm and 15cm M.1914 Field Howitzers only started to arrive to the frontline from 1915. As a result, the k. u. k. Army, like most other armies of the war, had to use some obsolete types to fill the gaps. Among others these included the slow firing 12cm and 15cm M.1880 Guns and the 15cm M.1899 Howitzer. There were some very heavy howitzers though, which were used with devastating effect. The most fearful Austro-Hungarian artillery piece was the Skoda 30,5cm M.1911 Mörser (Heavy Howitzer), also known as the 'thirty and half'. This monster could fire a 380 kg shell up to 9.600 meters and the splinter from the burst could kill unprotected soldiers within 400 meters...

Armoured vehicles

Unfortunately, the k. u. k. Army was very skeptical of armoured vehicles before the war, and remained skeptic throughout WWI. In 1905 an effective Austro-Daimler armoured car was presented to the Army, but it was rejected (allegedly by the Emperor himself), saying that this devilish machine would frighten to death the horses of the cavalry! In 1911 an inventor Günther Burstyn showed the plans of a Motorgeschütz (motorized gun, today we would call it a tank) to the Ministry of War, but it was also rejected because of 'financial problems'. A decision was made that the k. u. k. Army would concentrate on armoured trains instead. Although several armoured trains were built, these could be used only on railroad. There were some experimental armoured cars though, mainly built by enthusiastic officers at their own expense.

The k. u. k. Luftfahrtruppen (Aviation Troops)

Again, the importance of airplanes was seriously underrated before the war. Until 1911 no airplanes were bought by the K. u. k. Army. On September 15, 1910 Conrad von Hötzerndorf took off with a Farman / Voison biplane piloted by an officer named Warchalowsky. As a result of this flight Conrad realized the importance of aerial reconnaissance. Then he urged the Ministry of War to establish the Luftfahrtruppen (KukLFT) with 200 airplanes and 400 pilots and observers. In 1911 the production of the Etrich 'Taube' (Pigeon) monoplanes was started. In August 1911, 6 Taubes were used in a military exercise with great success. Despite his efforts, Austria-Hungary had to start the war with a few dozen obsolete Taube and Lohner planes. These were more dangerous to their crew than to the enemy. In the first days of the war a Taube was shot down by a Serb rifleman(!), so further flights above enemy territory with this type were banned. The first Austro-Hungarian 'B' type biplanes were unarmed, the observer could only use his personal weapon (revolver) to defend the aircraft with not much success. On the other hand, enemy Farman and Voison types were equipped with machine guns.

Austria-Hungary was also the last to establish fighter squadrons in 1917. Before that, in 1916, some fighters were added to standard reconnaissance squadrons. In the end of 1918 the KukLFT had 79 squadrons or 'Fliks', each operating with 6-12 planes. Of these there were:
- 51 reconnaissance squadrons
            (Flik-D)
- 10 long range reconnaissance
            squadrons (Flik-F)
- 13 fighter squadrons (Flik-J)
- 5 bomber squadrons (Flik-G)
The ten Austro-Hungarian aircraft factories built 5.400-5.600 planes by the end of the war. (Germany: 48.000, France: 52.000, Great Britain: 55.000) There were never enough as Italy alone built 12.000 planes and these were all used on the Italian Front, while Austria-Hungary had to distribute her planes to the three main theatres.


The k. u. k. Kriegsmarine (Navy)

The capital ships of the Austro-Hungarian Kriegsmarine spent most of the war in their well defended homeports in Pola and Triest. As they were outnumbered by the joint fleet of the French, British, and from 1915 Italian ships, their task was to hold down these units to lower the pressure on the German fleet. The anchored dreadnoughts represented a real threat to the Mediterranean waters so the Entente had to keep an even larger fleet ready to react. However, the smaller units of the k. u. k. Kriesgsmarine were used with considerable success on the Adriatic Sea. The fast scout cruisers, destroyers and torpedo boats attacked the Otranto Barrage several times. This sea barrage was set up by the Entente to imprison the German and Austro-Hungarian U-boats in the Adriatic Sea. Although Austria-Hungary started the war with only 6 U-boats (of which two were training boats) the submarine fleet had a most impressive record: the 27 U-boats sank 9 Entente warships:
- on April 27, 1915 the U 5 sank the French 'Leon Gambetta' armoured cruiser
- on July 18, 1915 the U 4 sank the Italian 'Giuseppe Garibaldi' armoured cruiser
- on August 5, 1915 the U 5 sank the Italian 'Nereide' submarine
- on March 18, 1916 the U 6 sank the French 'Renaudin' destroyer
- on June 16, 1916 the U 15 sank the French 'Fourche' destroyer
- on July 10, 1916 the U 17 sank the Italian  'Impetuoso' destroyer
- on October 17, 1916 the U 16 sank the Italian 'Nembo' torpedo boat
- on May 14, 1918 the U 27 sank the British 'Phoenix' destroyer
- on September 20, 1918 the U 47 sank the French 'Circe' submarine.

Additionally, they severely damaged some other units which did not return to active service until the end of the war:

- on December 21, 1914 the U 12 damaged the French 'Jean Bart' dreadnought with two torpedoes
- on June 9, 1915 the U 4 damaged the British 'Dublin' destroyer with one torpedo
- on June 11, 1917 the U 27 damaged the Japanese 'Sakaki' destroyer with one torpedo
- on October 2, 1918 the U 31 damaged the British 'Weymouth' cruiser with two torpedoes.

Of the 27 U-boats 16 were used against merchant shipping, together they sank 94 Entente merchant ships with 190.353 tons. (The 343 German U-boats sank 6.520 merchant ships with 3.286.462 tons.) With the exception of the U 14 (captured and renovated ex-French 'Curie') Austro-Hungarian U-boats could only carry 3-5 torpedoes and the maximum duration of their patrols was only 15-18 days. The losses:

- U 12 (273 tons): on August 12, 1915 ran on a mine near Venice. 17 died.
- U 3 (300 tons): on August 13, 1915 was damaged by the Italian 'Citta di Catania' armoured cruiser, then sank on the surface by the French 'Bisson' torpedo boat, E of Brindisi. 10 died, 12 captured
- U 6 (273 tons): on May 13, 1916 was stuck in an anti-submarine net and destroyed on the surface near Otranto. 20 captured.
- U 16 (141 tons): on October 17, 1916 was damaged by the exploding depth chargers of the sinking Italian 'Nembo' torpedo boat S of Valona. 2 died, 14 captured.
- U 30 (306 tons): after March 31, 1917 was lost without a trace E of Otranto. 21 MIA.
- U 5 (273 tons): on June 16, 1917 ran on an Italian mine near Pola. 6 died, 17 saved.
- U 23 (210 tons): on February 21, 1918 was sank by the Italian 'Airone' destroyer on the South Adriatic. 21 died.
- U 20 (210 tons): on July 4, 1918 was sunk by the Italian 'F-12' submarine near the mouth of the Tagliamento River. 18 died.
- U 10 (141 tons): on July 6, 1918 ran on a mine near Triest.


The Armory

Infantry units

- K. u. k. Infanterie: standard first levy infantry of the Austro-Hungarian Army.
- Landwehr and Honvéd Infanterie: see as above.
- Landsturm and Népfelkelõ Infanterie: second levy infantry units mainly consisting the older generations. Later many of these were merged into standard K. u. k. Infantry divisions.
- Gebirgs Infanterie: these mountain infantry units are trained in climbing and also well equipped, so they can move twice as fast on mountainous terrain and they can also cross rivers without delay.
- Kaiserjäger and Feldjäger: these are ranger type selected sharpshooters with increased attack value.
- K. u. k. Maschinengewehr Infanterie: these units are used to defend the key positions of the frontline, so they are equipped with machine guns, trench guns and mortars. Because of the heavy armament they are very slow so they are crying for an organic transport.
- Uhlanen, Husaren, Dragonen: Austro-Hungarian traditional cavalry refused to adopt the new pike gray uniform until early 1915 and used 19th century cavalry charge tactic. The result was heavy losses.
- K. u. k. Kavallerie: following the enormous cavalry losses in 1914, cavalry was mainly used in auxiliary role. Though highly mobile, they are not much more than mounted infantry with a reduced ground defense value (more vulnerable because of the horses).
- Sturmtruppen: 'storm troopers' or assault troops, these veteran units are trained by German instructors and are equipped with the latest technological advancements: hand grenades, flame-throwers, light machine guns, grenade launchers and such.

Artillery units

As the K. u. k. Army used many different guns and howitzers in the Great War each (modern) types are equally tempting. For example, light field guns are cheap, have much ammo and can move on their own, and, on the contrary, heavy artillery is expensive, have less ammo and can only moved by an organic transport. One of the main goals in the campaign will be to find a good balance of light artillery - heavy artillery units, short range howitzers - long range guns.
In K. u. k. General I only modeled those guns that I had the appropriate technical data and at least one photo or drawing. While calculating their values I followed these rules:

Soft Attack Value
- normally an 8cm (76mm) gun should have a soft attack value of 8, a 10cm gun should have 10 etc.
BUT:
- obsolete (19th century) guns received penalties, newer guns received bonus points
- howitzers received bonus points (they were more precise and they could attack targets behind obstacles e.g. mountains)
- Mörsers / heavy howitzers received penalties (it would unbalance the game play and they were not that good)

Maximum Ammo (it also represents the rate of fire)
- generally, light guns received bonus ammo (higher rate of fire), heavier guns received penalties (the opposite), ammunition was also much more expensive for heavy guns / howitzers
- obsolete guns without a recoil system received serious penalties (their crew had to re-aim the gun after every single shot so that their rate of fire was lower)

Range
- guns with a maximum (theoretical) range less than 6.000 meters: 1 hex
- guns with a maximum (theoretical) range between 6.000-9.000 meters: 2 hexes
- guns with a maximum (theoretical) range between 9.000-12.000 meters: 3 hexes
- guns with a maximum (theoretical) range above 12.000 meters: 4 hexes

Note that in Austro-Hungarian guns the 'M' stands for 'Muster' (German) or 'Minta'  (Hungarian), meaning 'pattern'.

- 12cm M.1880 and 15cm M.1880 Kanone (Cannon): these obsolete guns were the only available long range guns in the early months of the war.
- 7cm M.1899 Gerbirgskanone, 9cm and 10cm M.1899 Kanone: these guns were only used as there were shortages in newer types.
- 15cm M.1899 schweres Haubitze there were about 200 of these howitzers in 1914.
- 8cm M.1905/08 Feldkanone (Field Gun): the workhorse of the Austro-Hungarian light field artillery throughout the war. Like the German 7,7 cm 96 n.A. Feldkanone, the maximum range of this gun was lower than the Entente equivalents (French Schneider 76mm M1897, Russian Putyilov 76mm M1902, Italian Cannone da 75)
- 8cm M.1917  Feldkanone: these guns had an increased range and they were intended to replace the M.1905/08 8cm guns.
- 7,5cm M.1909, 7,5cm M.1915, 10cm M.1914, 10cm M.1916 Gebirgskanone (Mountain Gun): mountain guns were the lightweight versions of the standard field guns / howitzers to provide more mobility in rough terrain.
- 10cm M.1914 and 15cm M.1914 Feldhaubitze (Field Howitzer): the standard Austro-Hungarian field howitzers were produced in large numbers throughout the war.
- 10cm M.1914 and 15cm M.1915 Kanone: although these long range guns were to replace the obsolete M.1880 guns they were produced in relatively small numbers.
- 24cm M.1898  Mörser (Heavy Howitzer): the forefather of the later Skoda Heavy Howitzers. In 1914 there were 48 of these Mörsers, their number decreased throughout the war.
- 30,5cm M.1911 and M.1911/16 Mörser: being the most distinctive Austro-Hungarian weapon, it appeared on a number of posters and postcards. In reality 'thirty and halves' were mainly used separately or in pairs. Because of this, all of them were given a name. The one you can see on the opening screen of K.u.k. General was named 'Maxi'. The village house in the background partially collapsed while firing with 'Maxi' as a result of the air pressure...
- 42cm M.1914 Haubitze: these monsters were to defend the naval ports of Austria-Hungary. When the K. u. k. Navy stabilized the situation on the Adriatic Sea they became useless so Skoda was asked to make these howitzers mobile. They were first tested against the so-called Lowcen Guns above Cattaro, then they were used in South Tyrol, Romania and on the Russian Front as well. In 1918 the K.u.k. Army had 8 of these howitzers.

Armoured units

- Fross-Büssing: the chassis of a Büssing truck was covered with iron plates and a machine gun turret was also installed. Only 2-3 were built.
- Junovitz P. A. (Panzer Auto): different type of trucks were covered with armour plates and were equipped with 3-6 machine guns. 5-7 were built.
- Romfell: built by two Austro-Hungarian officers, it was the most sophisticated armoured car as it had a 4x4 wheel drive mechanism so it could be used on rough terrain as well. Only 2 were built.
- Burstyn Tank: it is not historically accurate as none were built, but I also added this so that the player can test it. However, it can be purchased only in 1918, and it will cost more than its actual value (a lot of prestige is needed to convince the Ministry of War that the army needs this revolutionary weapon...).

Air units

The ten Austro-Hungarian aircraft factories were scattered around the Empire. The two largest were the Phönix A.G. (Stadlau, Wien) and the U.F.A.G. (Albertfalva, Budapest). These two built almost half of the planes. As the ten factories built more than 40 different types, I only modeled the most influential ones. Most planes were built under German license, but there were some unique Austro-Hungarian designs as well.
Austro-Hungarian (and German) aircraft designations:
'B': 	(unarmed) two-seater, with the observer seating in front of the pilot
'C': 	(armed) two-seater, with the observer in the aft cockpit
'D': 	'Doppeldecker', biplane, later: fighter, in general
'E': 	'Eindecker', monoplane
'G': 	'Grosskampfflugzeug', bomber
'J': 	ground-attack aircraft
'Dr': 	'Dreidecker', triplane

Reconnaissance Aircraft:
- Lohner B.II: the first more or less effective, but not very reliable biplane, the Lohner B.II was used in the first months of the war. 111 were built.
- Aviatik B.II: these were mostly used on the Eastern Front. 133 were built.
- Albatros B.I: it was the first reliable biplane. 171 were built.
- Brandernburg B.I: the first representative of the very successful Brandenburg family, it was reliable and fast. 414 were built.
- Lloyd C.II: in spring 1915, these planes were equipped with a defensive machine gun, so these were the first armed Austro-Hungarian planes. 71 were built. (Lloyd C.III: 52, Lloyd C.IV: 38, Lloyd C.V: 144)
- Brandenburg C.I (early series, 160HP, 1916): the most successful Austro-Hungarian aircraft, the Brandenburg C.I was being built until the end of the war, in different versions. It was equipped with a defensive machine gun and with another forward firing machine gun, installed on the top of the upper wing. Many Austro-Hungarian aces achieved their first victories flying this type. 468 were built.
- Aviatik-Berg C.I: not identical to the German Aviatik C.I, it was the first 'fast' reconnaissance aircraft. 255 were built.
- Brandenburg C.I (later series, 200HP, 1917): though not as successful as the early series, this improved version was still good enough in 1917. 361 were built.
- U.F.A.G. C.I (also known as UC.I): when the Brandenburg C.I reached its limits in 1918, the Ungarische-Flugzeugfabrik A.G. came up with this type, which remained in service until the end of the war. 282 were built.
- Phönix C.I: almost identical to the U.F.A.G. C.I,  it was slightly better at high altitude, but also slower and slightly worse at low altitude. 160 were built.
- Brandenburg C.I (last series, 230HP, 1918): in spite of the improvements, by 1918 the Brandenburg C.I became obsolete, so it was only used for short range reconnaissance missions. 386 were built.

Fighters:
- Brandenburg D.I (also known as the 'KD' fighter): the first successful Austro-Hungarian fighter was sturdy and fast, but was inferior to the more advanced Albatros D.III fighter. 157 were built.
- Albatros D.III (series 153, 200 HP, 1917): most Austro-Hungarian aces achieved their victories flying this type. The improved ÖFFAG Albatros D.III was even better than the original German Albatros D.III and D.V types, and remained the primary Austro-Hungarian fighter until the end of the war. 281 were built.
- Aviatik-Berg D.I (early series, 160-200HP, 1917): the first entirely Austro-Hungarian fighter design was a bit flawed and had a tendency to lose its wings in high-speed dives. 663 were built.
- Phönix D.I: the improved version of the Brandenburg D.I, it was also very sturdy and easy to handle, but it was not very fast. 120 were built.
- Albatros D.III (series 253, 225HP, 1918): probably the best Austro-Hungarian fighter, it was still inferior to the Sopwith Camel and the SPAD S.XIII. 260 were built.
- Aviatik-Berg D.I (later series, 225HP, 1918): the structure of the later series were strengthened making it a potent fighter. 200 were built.
- Phönix D.IIa: the lighter and improved version of the Phönix D.I had a more powerful engine. 48 were built.


Naval units

Changes since Panzer General:

- Forts and bunkers are now naval targets and thus naval target class is renamed as Naval/Fort target and naval attack is renamed as Naval/Fort attack. From now only tanks and armoured cars are hard targets. I decided to make this change to differentiate between armoured units and concrete bunkers - by this time they shared the hard target class, unrealistically. So, from this time heavy howitzers and siege mortars have high Naval/Fort attack and low Hard attack, light field guns have low Naval/Fort attack and relatively high Hard attack (lacking effective anti-tank guns, light field guns were often used against tanks in WWI).
- Airplanes have much less ammo - reconnaissance planes can attack 1-3 times, fighters can attack 2-4 times. (Idea adopted from Kaiser General)
- Only light artillery (75mm Field Guns and 75-100mm Mountain Guns) can move on their own i.e. without embarking to a transport. In this way, only light artillery units can follow slowly the advancing/withdrawing infantry divisions and thus provide defensive fire. (I saw images of light guns moved by their crew, but it is quite unrealistic to move a gun heavier than 1-1,5 ton by its crew of 6-8. In Kaiser General no artillery could be moved without embarking.)
- Allied (Entente) forces can not purchase any reinforcement units during a scenario. (What annoyed me the most in Panzer General was that when I was only one turn from capturing the last objective, and then mysteriously appeared 6-7 infantry/partisan or 37mm AT Guns in front of my troops, occupying the last city and its surroundings and forcing me to spend another 2-3 turns to destroy them.) Actually, there will be enemy reinforcements, but they will be present from the first turn and the A.I. has to move them to the frontline. My other reason to did so was that the number of infantry and artillery units is based on historical data in most scenarios (1 infantry unit = 1 infantry division, 1 artillery unit = 100 guns/howitzers, in the second half of the war 200 guns/howitzers), and the A.I.'s uncontrolled purchases would ruin historical accuracy in the very moment.
- Mountain infantry units now have an air movement of 2. Mountain infantry was very important in WWI and I wanted to make them twice as fast in mountainous / rough terrain as normal infantry units, and this was the only way I could do this. The only problem is that their movement sound is a bit strange, to say the least.


1st scenario: Bosnia. Dress rehearsal in a long hot summer.
June, 1914
After the second Balkan war tension built up between Serbia and Austria-Hungary. In summer 1914 a military exercise was held in Bosnia-Hezegovina 80 kilometers from the Serbian boarder. When the exercise was over Franz Ferdinand visited Sarajevo to review the k. u. k. troops which took part in the operation. The rest is history.

2st scenario: Serbia (1914). The second and third Austro-Hungarian attacks on Serbia.
September - December, 1914
In 1914 Austria-Hungary had two enemies to deal with: Serbia (Balkans) and Russia. In Russia all battles were lost so I chose Serbia where at least a partial victory preceded the withdraw. This scenario is not an easy one though, so the player has many turns to capture all objectives. Serbian troops were more experienced as they took part in two Balkan wars (in 1912 and in 1913) and they were also more motivated. On the other hand, the K. u. k. Army had some heavy artillery and monitors on the Danube River. The K.u.k. Army had 12 regular infantry divisions and 3 Landsturm / Népfelkelõ brigades. So, you have 12 K.u.k. Inf and 2 Landsturm units. The Serbian Army had some 10-12 infantry divisions with Komitaji (partisan) units and light artillery.
There is also a side-mission: the naval port of Boche di Cattaro is under fire by the so-called Lowcen guns. Cattaro is next to the Montenegrin boarder, within the range of the Serbian artillery  positions on the nearby Mount Lowcen. You can try to destroy these guns with the ships and thus test the K.u.k. Kriegsmarine as well. This knowledge may be useful in later naval missions.

3nd scenario: Carpathian winter offensive. Blood red winter in the Carpathian Mountains.
January -March, 1915
This scenario is much more complex: the player has to control dozens of units in a large map. It is very hard, if not impossible to capture all objectives in time while holding the besieged fortress of Przemysl (to be precise it was a system of 15 large fortresses around Przemysl with more than 120.000 defenders). The core units will attack from the South East (Gen Pflanzer-Baltin's Army). They will not encounter strong enemy resistance on their way to Stanislav, in the Bukovina region. The rest of the army will have a hard fight though, and bad weather will also slow down the advance. The hardest part will be probably the capture of Baligrod (as in reality). The number and type of Austro-Hungarian and German units are again based on historical data. (In reality Gen Boroevic and Gen Linsingen were unable to reach their objectives: the besieged Przemysl and Strij, while Gen Pflanzer-Baltin captured Stanislav.)

4th scenario: Gorlice. The first major victory of the k. u. k. Army.
May - June, 1915
The first artillery concentration on the Eastern Front had a devastating effect. The core units remain in Bukovina and they have to continue to advance towards Strij. The majority of the German-Austro-Hungarian Army will attack near Gorlice. In this scenario there is quite a lot of action and movement. The number and type of Austro-Hungarian and German infantry divisions and artillery is more or less based on historical data (so is the Russian).

5th scenario: Ancona. The Austro-Hungarian 'Pearl Harbor style' surprise attack.
May 23, 1915
When Italy declared war on Austria-Hungary the k. u. k. Kriegsmarine had no other choice but to act quickly. This surprise attack had an impact on the Italian mobilization and saved time for the successful defense. You must destroy all enemy units to win this scenario, otherwise your career ends.

6th scenario: Isonzo River (1915). The first and second Italian attacks at the Isonzo River.
June - July, 1915
This is the first defensive scenario. The core units must defend the line of the Isonzo River, while aux units start a counter attack and capture Cortina in the Dolomites. This scenario is partly unrealistic as Cortina d'Ampezzo was never recaptured by the k. u. k. Army.

7th scenario: Serbia (1915). The final invasion of Serbia.
October - December, 1915
This battle was one of those few in which the Central Powers outnumbered the Entente forces. The Serbian Army was severely weakened in 1914, and lost its ability to attack. The joint forces of the Central Powers has all the resources and equipment that is necessary for a successful offensive. Victory is indisputable, the only question is when.

8th scenario: Albania. Finishing the work in the Balkans.
January - February, 1916
Here you have to invade Serbia's sister state Montenegro and liberate Albania from the Italian occupation. You can only use a reduced size army as it is not a major offensive. Besides the Montenegrin, Serb and Italian troops you have another enemy: weather.

9th scenario: South Tyrol. Trench war in the Southern Alps.
May - June, 1916
In May, 1916 Austro-Hungarian General Staff felt that the k. u. k. Army is strong enough to launch an offensive without German support. The idea was to break through the Italian positions in the Southern Alps and than continue to advance South towards the Adriatic Sea. The final aim was to encircle the Italian main forces at the Isonzo River. To make it possible, the k. u. k. Army concentrated 15 infantry divisions and 900 artillery pieces in South Tyrol. The offensive was postponed several times because of the bad weather, and when it finally started the advance was slow, but initially successful. However, as news of the successful Russian offensive arrived, the attack had to be stopped and heavy artillery and infantry was transferred to the Eastern Front.

10th scenario: Brusiov's Offensive. The beginning of the end.
June - July, 1916
The General Staff was surprised by the initial success of Brusilov's offensive. The Russian offensive was hardly stopped by the reinforcements from South Tyrol and by the German forces from the Western Front. The k. u. k. Army suffered the highest losses in the Great War, but one must mention that Russian losses were almost as high. This slaughter seriously weakened both armies, and paved the way for the fall of both Empires. If you sacrifice some infantry divisions heartlessly you have a good chance to win this scenario. Despite the terrific casualties, the horror continues.

11th scenario: Romania. Shortening the frontline.
November - December, 1916
Romania declared war on Austria-Hungary when Brusilov's offensive was on the move. After the Russian offensive was defeated, the Central Powers decided to deal with Romania. In comparison with the preceding scenario this will be a pleasant walking. Most of the Romanian Army is inexperienced, and is lacking heavy artillery.

12th scenario: Otranto (1917). The biggest victory of the k. u. k. Kriegsmarine.
May, 1917
This attack was planned by Miklós Horthy, who was the captain of the Novara Light Cruiser. The Otranto sea barrage was virtually destroyed and the way was clear for the U-boats. Due to Panzer General limitations you can only achieve victory by capturing an objective with the Mg Inf unit. You can provide supportive fire with the cruisers, but first you must destroy some merchants. Too bad that the Entente fleet will not wait passively in the meantime...

13th scenario: Isonzo (1917). The tenth Italian attack at the Isonzo River
May - June, 1917
The Italians continued their attacks at the Isonzo in 1916 and 1917. During these they achieved very little but capturing Görz. This time it is their tenth attack which must be defeated. After doing so you may or may not try to retake Görz and Mt. Saint Michelle.

14th scenario: Kerensky's offensive. The first and last attack of the provisional government.
June - July, 1917
After the fall of tsarism, the aristocrat provisional government persuaded the Russian army to launch one last offensive. This time the German-Austro-Hungarian forces were not surprised, instead, they waited the offensive, and prepared a counter-attack. The Russians managed to break through the frontline with great losses, but then the German-Austro-Hungarian forces recaptured a large portion of Bukovina and Galizia. The Russian Army started to disintegrate and the Civil War was on the way. The last reliable Russian divisions represent a real threat, so do not underestimate their strength. You can easily lose one or more core units if you do so.

15th scenario: Caporetto. The Caporetto 'miracle'.
October - November, 1917
By 1917 the Central Powers (and especially Austria-Hungary) were exhausted and reached their limits. And still, in their ragged uniforms, the starving, under strength units of the German-Austro-Hungarian army managed to break through the Italian frontline near Caporetto (today Kobarid, Slovenia) pretty easily. The pre-planned 'maximum' was to reach the Tagliamento River, but the offensive was stopped at the Piave River, even farther. Italy was only saved by the French - British reinforcements which were transferred from the Western Front. Although it was a major victory, it had a cost: the k. u. k. Army used up its resources and lost its ability to attack for long months...

16th scenario: Otranto (1918). The sinking of the Szent István dreadnought.
June, 1918
The so-called Battle of Otranto is well documented, but it is not very well known that there were other, not so successful attacks on the Otranto sea barrage as well. This one was disastrous, though. Following the mutiny in Cattaro, a new commander-in-chief was appointed for the k. u. k. Kriegsmarine. Vice Admiral Horthy's first thing to do was to plan another attack on the Otranto sea barrage, mainly to strengthen the moral of the Navy. He wanted to use the dreadnoughts as well, as they spent most of the war in their homeports. The operation was just started when two torpedoes hit the 'Szent István' sinking her two hours later. The surprise was lost, so the operation was immediately called off. In this scenario you can continue on and see the results.

17th scenario: Piave. The ill-fated Austro-Hungarian offensive at the Piave River.
June - July, 1918
When the Germans launched their spring offensive on the Western Front, the Austro-Hungarian General Staff also promised to attack the Italian Frontline to relieve the Germans. However, the circumstances for an Austro-Hungarian offensive were not optimal, to say the least. Austro-Hungarian fighters were outnumbered (280 Austrian planes faced 534 Italian and British) and were unable to gain air superiority. The condition of the k. u. k. Army was worse than ever.
In K. u. k. General your core units can make the difference as this scenario is the key for winning the war. If you achieve a Major or Minor Victory, you are redirected to the Balkans where a Major Victory is required to get to Verona. If you lose (historical reality), then it is the Italians turn to attack, which you will unlikely defeat.

18th scenario: Balkans. The Balkans on fire again.
September - October, 1918
When Franchet d'Esperey started his offensive in the Balkans he had 10 Greek, 8 French, 6 Serb, 4 British and 1 Italian infantry divisions. This well equipped coalition army faced 15 weak and exhausted Bulgarian infantry divisions who had enough of the world war. In a few days the whole frontline collapsed and many soldiers simply went home. Austro-Hungarian reinforcements from the Eastern and Italian Fronts arrived slowly as there were not enough transport capacity. Again, in this scenario your core army make the change, and start a counter-attack. The only way to achieve a Major Victory is to capture all objectives by the last turn. In this way you can get a last chance to win the war.

19th scenario: Verona. Hypothetical scenario.
October, 1918
The 'minimal' aim of the Piave Offensive was to reach the Brenta River, so you start from here. If you get access to this scenario you should not have a problem in achieving a Major Victory, otherwise the k. u. k. Army retreats to the Piave River and you are redirected to 'The Collapse'. In this scenario you can test the so-called Burstyn tank, which only existed on paper, but I could not resist the temptation to add it to the unit list. If you want to be historically accurate just do not purchase it (but, anyway this is a hypothetical scenario...).

20th scenario The Collapse. Get ready for the Second World War.
October - November, 1918
When the Italians finally decided to attack the Austro-Hungarian frontline, the k.u.k. Army virtually already ceased to exist. Whole regiments refused to follow orders, and thousands of soldiers deserted or surrendered to the enemy. However, in K. u. k. General there is a slight chance to halt the Entente offensive with your core army and to achieve a Minor Victory. For this you only need to hold one objective. If you can do it (without cheating) please contact me, and send me the last save game...

Additional scenario: Pelagosa Island. More action on the Adriatic Sea.
August, 1915
This scenario is not accessible during the campaign. It is for testing submerged/surfaced subs, an idea suggested by Allied General Workshop.
In August, 1915 there was quite a lot of action on the Adriatic Sea:
- The Italian airship 'Citta de Jesi' was shot down by air defense fire above Pola.
- August 4: the Austro-Hungarian U-5 sank the Italian 'Nereida' submarine.
- August 7: the Austro-Hungarian U-12 was sank by a mine near Venice.
- August 13: the Austro-Hungarian U-3 was sank by an Italian destroyer near Brindisi.
- August 17: a small Austro-Hungarian task force led by the 'Saida' Light Cruiser invaded Pelagosa Island which was recently captured by Italian marines. The returning task force was attacked by the French submarine 'Papin' which sank the 51-T Torpedo Boat.

- Try to save as much prestige for the last scenarios as possible.
Keep in mind that elite replacements of expensive units will cost you much prestige. You should only upgrade obsolete air units. You should not use elite replacements for expensive auxiliary units.
- Use your airplanes carefully.
Although you cannot attack air units with your airplanes until 1916, there is one way to get rid of an unpleasant enemy biplane: if you position two recon planes on the opposing hexes of an enemy air unit, it cannot get back to its airfield and sooner or later run out of fuel and disappear from the map. If any of your planes is running low on gas send it back to an airfield and replace it with another. This is not cheating, as it simulates a technique when enemy planes were forced to crash land by a skillful pilot. Some Austro-Hungarian aces achieved their first victories using this technique. In 1918 the k. u. k. Luftfahrtruppen was heavily outnumbered and outgunned on the Italian Front, so these final scenarios need special attention.
- Pay special attention to your core army composition.
If you want to remain historically accurate, in 1918 you should not have more than 2-3 fighters, 4 recon aircraft units, 1 level bomber, 4-5 heavy artillery units, and 1 armoured car. In 1918 you should have at least 5 infantry units and 1-2 air-defense / anti-aircraft units. Naturally, you can try other core compositions as well.
- Always make a save game at the end of a scenario.


'How to break through the enemy frontline?'
 A pocket guide by Private Steve McGuba
1. By using your reconnaissance aircraft and observation balloons specify the weakest point(s) of the enemy frontline.
2. Concentrate your (heavy) artillery units there and start bombarding big time for at least 1-2 turns preferably.
3. Send in your expendable (auxiliary) infantry units first with direct (light) artillery support in their back.
4. Break through the enemy frontline with 	your first, second or a further wave of infantry.
5. Once succeeded, attack artillery units in the back of the enemy frontline.
6. Start rolling up the enemy's flank.
7. Start to advance towards your victory objectives.
8. Lean back in your armchair.


The Making of K.u.k. General

Bullet strikes the helmet's head
And it's all over
For the Unknown Soldier

The Doors


I started to play Kaiser General in 2002 with great fascination. Like most other people I thought that in WWI there was not much movement and action, and soldiers spent their time in the trenches. It is only partially true. Apart from the first and last months of the war the Western Front was not moved, but there was quite a lot of movement on the Eastern, Italian and Southern (Balkan) Frontlines throughout WWI. It was well represented in the original Kaiser General campaign for PG, but unfortunately it ended in 1916. Being a Hungarian I first started to create a Hungarian WWII campaign for PG which I gave up after the first three scenarios. Then I turned my attention to WWI and Kaiser General. In 2003 I started to create an Austro-Hungarian campaign from scratch using the e-file, maps, and unit icons of Kaiser General, just for my own enjoyment. As I progressed I modified most of these to make it even more accurate historically. At the same time I started to read books on WWI and to browse the Internet for every little bits of information. After two or three months I lost interest and gave up development. In 2004 while climbing in the Dolomites in Northern Italy we encountered some WWI garrisons and bunkers 3.000 meters above sea level where I was touched by the ghosts of the Great War. As a result, I restarted the project, but again, I lost interest and gave it up after 2-3 months. The same happened in 2005, but in April 2006 I restarted the development once more and I felt that it is good enough to release it to the public. Then I started a topic on JP's Panzer Forum (www.panzercentral.com/forum) and contacted Champ and RhinoBones, the creators of Kaiser General. (Its scenarios, maps and e-file were made by RhinoBones, the unit icons, briefings, screens and campaign flow were made by Phil Champ.) Both of them encouraged me to finish it, and in his very first reply Phil kindly offered his help in testing. Now, you can see the result...

Steve McGuba, May, 2006.

Addenda for v2.0:
After finishing v1.0 I wanted to increase graphical and historical accuracy within PG limitations. This version may be a bit harder as all Axis units are slightly more expensive and some units are slightly less effective. On the other hand some enemy units are more effective. Generally speaking, air war is probably a bit more challenging. There are four new scenarios, but many v1.0 scenarios were changed more or less, too. I NUPL-edited the panzer.exe so the player can now purchase more units. Austrian Landwehr and Hungarian Honvéd and Népfelkelõ infantry units were added. The most obvious change is the tacmap graphics. I wanted to see continuous frontlines and more detail in the land hexes. Ocean hexes are also new - there are no more plain blue ocean hexes. I drew new aerodrome (airfield) hexes. I added new city hexes using resized PG2 graphics - I had some palette problems with it so it is not perfect. I redrew many unit icons more or less.

Many thanks for these guys: Pepa Drobny (bug report, editing the campaign tree, technical and historical information and more), Radoye1 (historical information, suggestions), Allied General Workshop (new ideas for mountain infantry and submerged submarines).
