This is for a strategy game, like Warcraft or Starcraft, it's should be grid based like Warcraft II, all units occupy one square, except buildings (there's an image that explains how much they occupy)...

There are graphics for the red and blue players only...

These are the units you can use:

Worker = used to harvest minerals and create buildings, it can attack but it's very weak...

Light Warrior = the first line of defense, it attacks with a sword with low range of course

Solar Bird = it attacks from mid-range, it throws energy rays..

Thunder Maker = This is the mage of the game, attacks with small rays that are casted directly over the enemy unit,  cast storms, energy shields and freezes enemies...

Pulse Cannon = a very powerful enemy, it shoots like the Zerg Guardian from Starcraft, from long range... it moves slow...
