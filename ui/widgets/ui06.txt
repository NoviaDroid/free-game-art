Hi, it's me again. Here i post another idea for a g.u.i.

It's just a few ideas, that i will continue designing.

For now, the set includes: health and mana bar, vault window, quest window, spells window, quick spellsbar, system icons for "character, vault, spells, configuration and chat".

I post the source, that will be updated when i make changes.

Ask and suggestions are welcome.

I hope you like it.

Feel free to use. Just credit me.

Cheers! =)
