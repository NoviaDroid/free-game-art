Well... naming isn't my strong. (?)
This is a iconset maded for the gui proyect i'm doing.
Originally drawed in a 32x32px box.
Interpoled to 16x16px, and they look good, i think.

In this time i draw the form lines in the pixel art style, and paint it with brush.
i added some semitransparent pixels for "antialiasing" too
