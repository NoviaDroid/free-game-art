So many RPGs have buildings and shops you pretty much have to enter to find out what they are.  In the real medieval and modern world signs are used to solve that problem.  These signs are simple, images, so:

1) they can be used for various purposes, and
2) they make sense for a semi-literate society,
3) they can be recognized by the player at a distance

If you find these images useful, I'd appreciate it if you send me a line, with a link to your project -- just to satisfy my curiosity.  I wouldn't turn down a complimentary copy of your game either
