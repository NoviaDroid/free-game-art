An expansion for my icon pack:

Ravenmore Icon Pack

But works very well on its own :)

If you want to use the basic versions like in the example, download the original pack - it contains both basic icons and this upgrade.

Have fun!

-- Adding this was suggested by the fine fellows at http://traptics.com/site/

Hope you find it useful!
