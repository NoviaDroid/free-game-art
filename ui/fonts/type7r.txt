Type7r is a spritefont which was created for retro-styled projects. It's size is 7x7px and it is preformated to fit into construct 2's standard-settings. So it's basically plug and play. ^^

I recommend setting the character spacing to -1 because it would be a 5x6px font without the outlines. ;)

You can use it as you wish and if you use it: I would be happy to see your project. :)
