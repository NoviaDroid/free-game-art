A medieval-inspired bitmap font, average character dimension: 11 pixels wide by 14 pixels high (some variation in this standard for special cases or ornamentation).

 

Includes the following characters:

ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ.,!?;:'1234567890

 

 

I'm open to feedback on this, BTW... I'd love to hear any suggestions or comments. :)
