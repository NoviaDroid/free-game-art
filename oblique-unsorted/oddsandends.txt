These things accumulate, I think, around any pixel artist.  Bits of this and that, test pieces, etc.  I have a few on my laptop, so I thought I'd throw them up here.  A few failed monsters for Bartk's rpg (wrong style), a failed fakemon, a couple of orthographic critters, some assorted isometric stuff, a jelly type overworld monster and what was going to be my "get in the game" entry, but didn't seem good enough (not a very good likeness to me beyond the general, either).

So yeah.  Not a lot to see here, but if something catches your fancy go for it.
