There are many great item sets out there, but to mix them is very difficult, because they use all different colors and art styles. After i saw the brilliant 16 color palette from DawnBringer (http://www.pixeljoint.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=12795), i had the idea to recolor "all" available items, skills, tiles, etc. which are under a free licence.


At the moment i use a few of my own sprites,

the "420 pixel art icons" from 7Souls (http://7soul1.deviantart.com/?rnrd=74632),

"32x32 Fantasy Tileset" from Jerom (http://opengameart.org/content/32x32-fantasy-tileset).

and "Crawl Tiles" from Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup (https://code.google.com/p/crawl-tiles/)
