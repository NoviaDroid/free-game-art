Many years ago, I drew around 700 fantasy-themed avatar images for a games competition. The game (“Last Guardian”) didn’t win, and I didn’t use haven’t used the sprites since then, so I’m now offering the whole package [ZIP] under a Creative Commons license Creative Commons attribution 3.0 for you to use.

Update (2013-09): I’m changing the license for these sprites to an even more open one which includes commercial use: Creative Commons attribution 3.0.
