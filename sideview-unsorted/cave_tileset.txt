This one was made for a commission that ended up in nothing (probably because of the poor quality of the majority of the work I had made... but that's another story).

In any case, here you have it - 32x32 cave tileset made using colors from the Dawnbringer's 32 color palette.

(yes, I know barrels' perspective is wrong - I won't bother fixing it anymore, but if you want to you're welcome)
