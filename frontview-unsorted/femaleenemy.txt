Front-view mage-like enemy.

Created originally for my current game project. Didn't fit with the setting of the game though, so I thought I'd upload it here in hopes that someone might find some use for it ;)

Sprite uses Magic Pink for background (255,0,255), and has the palette of colors I used in the upper left hand corner (for easier editing).
