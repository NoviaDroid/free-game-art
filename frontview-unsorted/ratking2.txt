Hello everyone.  I made this because BartK mentioned that he needed a rat king for his much-(and long-)anticipated game, and that he was using Antifarea's rpg enemies in it.  This image kind of came to me, so I drew it, with reference, pallette and modified face from Charles Gabriel's work (fun sprites to work with. See http://opengameart.org/content/10-fantasy-rpg-enemies).  It was a good time-spender, and it brought Mystic Quest to mind, and that was my first RPG ever.
