These are objects from a game I was working on long ago, however it has since been abandoned and I would hate to see these go to waste. They are already set up in 32x32 spaces with a transparent background.

 

I've gone ahead and uploaded an alternate set that I did a few months ago that includes more detail, new objects, and a revised palette. I'll leave both versions up, so that you may choose which ever you'd prefer.
