Here is my new section dedicated to all the free sprites I make for you to use for your games and stuff.

Feel free to use these sprites for your game or any other project, commercial or noncommercial, with no charge to you, just be sure to give credit to me (MillionthVector) in the credits or somewhere in your game, thanks!
