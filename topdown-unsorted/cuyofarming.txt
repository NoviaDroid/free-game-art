These are the graphics for the Cuyo level Farming. The tile size is 32x32, but in order to get a full set of tiles, the 16x16 sub-tiles have to be rearranged.

This set of assets uses Dawnbringer's db32 palette.

The graphics are dual licensed under the GPLv2 and under the OINM license version 0 (see http://www.weyer-zuhause.de/mark/software/oinm_license_0).
