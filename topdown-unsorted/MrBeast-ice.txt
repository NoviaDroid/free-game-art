Made/edited for the Eternal Ice Art Challenge!!!

Very little of this work was done myself as I took most of it from MrBeast's Incredible desert tileset

I did however create the little inuit type character from scratch which I'm quite impressed with (they are actually awful...) seeing as I'm not a pixel artist :P

If you use the tileset you should credit MrBeast!
