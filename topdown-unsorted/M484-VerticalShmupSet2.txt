This is another complete gfx set for a basic vertical shoot'em up.

The size of most things is 30*30 pixels. I included a few explosions and bullets, but if you need more then look at my earlier gfx sets that I have posted here at OGA; the older stuff should be fairly compatible with this one. :)

The assets in this set are pretty much basic stuff: various objects and ground tiles for 2 levels.

Notice that the tanks have 2 parts: turret and the base, so when using them you'll need to know how to program 2 sprites that are joined in all movements hehe. And also, notice the "yellow versions" of the sprites; those yellow frames are intended to be "damage flashes", which should look cool although I haven's tested them.
