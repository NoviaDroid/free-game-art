What the title says. Zelda-like top-down perspective (which sort of implies: I know there are some perspective flaws). Floor tiles are 16x16, wall tiles (and the rest) are 32x32. (The idea is that 4 of the floor tiles are to be combined program-side into a 32x32 tile, so that all the combinations are covered).

This comes from a job I made for a programmer who agreed this to be released under a free license. My thanks to him for this.
