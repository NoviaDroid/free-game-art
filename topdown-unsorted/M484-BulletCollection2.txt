Here are some more bullets for you; this is the M484 Games Bullet Collection number 2.

For this set I tried to raise the quality a little bit; aiming for Arcade standards rather than Amiga standards. Although I don't know if that made any real difference in the end lol. But they look quite nice to me. :)

The most notable things here are the 16-way blaster bullets, the spinners and the Gradius inspired ripple beam effects.

And as you can notice I also included some "usage examples" there, which give some cool ideas of how the gfx might be used.

And if you like these and are planning to use them in a shmup, then make sure to also check out the "Lightning Weapon" that I made earlier, it follows the same style:
