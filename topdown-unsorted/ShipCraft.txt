First part to a big project full of pieces to make pixelated space craft. Nothing extradordinarily new, but I was bored. Enjoy the collection here. Give credit please, and let me know if you used it. 

This collection consists of pieces that all fit well together and have a limit of 16777216 possible comibinations. There are 5 different kinds of ship peices: Cockpit, Hull, Weapons, Thrusters, and Wings. With 8 different models for each. 

The Hadron unit is comprised of dark ships with dim colors. Using the last model of each ship part creates a ship monstrously bad ass.
