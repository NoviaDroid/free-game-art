Simple Top down Space shooter assets I created to dip my toes in pixel art. You can add the assets to the game tutorial found at - http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/canvas/notearsgame/

That is not my tutorial, but just helpful :)

There's only 2 assets in this- 
1 x Futuristic alien destroying space vessle of Doom
1 x Tenticaled, brain-popping, slime-beast from the depths of a blackhole
