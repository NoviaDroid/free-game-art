Hello everyone,

This is, pretty simply, an overworld rat (here: http://opengameart.org/content/10-fantasy-rpg-enemies) and rat king (here: http://opengameart.org/content/rat-king-antifarea-style-rpg-enemy).  They're meant to be compatible with Antifarea's 16x18 rpg sprittles.  Fun stuff, working at this size, especially the animations.
