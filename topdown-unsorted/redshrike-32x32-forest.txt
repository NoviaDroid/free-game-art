Hello once again!  Here we have a 32x32 forest tileset with some grass/undergrowth, a tree, a forest, a cliffside and some various odds and ends.  It comes in both a dark version and, by popular IRC demand, a somewhat lightened version.  Feel free to make your own coloration!  Also included are a few interior tiles I did as a test.

These tiles were comissioned by Gaurav Munjal for his awesome HTML5 Canvas Old School RPG, which you can see at http://gaurav0.github.com/Old-School-RPG-Map.I definitely suggest you check it out.
