This is a collection of images I was going to used for a RPG that I'm creating but decided to change the style thus I don't need these for myself and considered my "junk."  One persons trash is anothers treasure so enjoy.

The art was done by Robson Michel but I am the sole owener of the assets.

These assets did cost me money but I'm giving it to you for free.  All I ask for you to do is follow my game blog here
