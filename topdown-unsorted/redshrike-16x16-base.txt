Well, I think I've had this floating around long enough, so I'll just upload it now rather than thinking I'll update it more later.  I think there are a few reasons that this might not be very useful: sort of awkward size, general wonkiness, lack of any accessories, etc.  I think it covers the most important poses, though.  Who knows, might be useful for something.  If someone has interest I might be able to do more with/on it at some point in the future--just shoot me a message or leave a comment.
