OK, I mentioned when I first posted my indoor tileset (http://opengameart.org/content/16x16-indoor-rpg-tileset-the-baseline) I mentioned that I would like to expand it some, add some bells, whistles, etc.  This is a step in that direction.  Included are new, updated extra-tall walls, wall hangings, another rug, a new table.

PLUS: a bunch of new accessories: plates, books, bottles, potted plants, a jug, etc, which are adapted from Jetrel's awesome item set over here: http://opengameart.org/content/rpg-item-set .  Essentially, I have resized them and some a few minor modifications to make them fit stylistically.  If there's more things you'd like to see, just drop a post in the comments.
