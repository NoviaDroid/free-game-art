The OPP project was started in april 2013 by Daniel 'Hapiel' Siegmund. Since then many contributers have submitted artwork to this set.
You can use all the art from the OPP project ANY WAY YOU LIKE, as long as you CREDIT ALL THE CONTRIBUTORS!
The OPP project artwork is released under a CC-BY-3.0 license

All artwork in this set is pixel art, limited to the 32 colors of the DB32 palette (included).
If you would like to make your own art in the OPP style, the styleguide can be found here
http://www.pixeljoint.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=16248&PID=173455#173455

Some of the artworks are unfinished, but the license allows you to modify of course.
If you are interested, browse trough the different forum threads to find some more inspiration and unfinished works that you are alowed to build on!
Have a look at the 'demo' folder, it shows how the tiles and sprites can be used. Sorry, not all of the stuff found in 'demo' can also be found in 'tiles'...
