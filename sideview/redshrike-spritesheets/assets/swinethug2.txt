This was a test piece to see how viable doing a set of pixel art versions of the beasts from ancient beast would be.  The results are pretty decent, but time-consuming enough to be shelved.  But I figured it might as well go up here.

You can see the painted version here: http://ancientbeast.com/bestiary/#Swine_Thug

Enjoy.
