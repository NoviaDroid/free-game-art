Hello everyone,

This was a pretty fun challenge!  I was surprized at how little I ended up getting done in 15 minutes.  I was hoping to just do a simple design and make a few poses, but I realized at the end that it would make more sense to refine what I already had.  So, here he is.  I kinda like how he turned out, maybe I'll do something else with him in the future.  Or maybe one of you will?
