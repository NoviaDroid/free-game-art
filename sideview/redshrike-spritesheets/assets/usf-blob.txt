This is The Blob, a character created for Ultimate Smash Friends and loosely based on one of their previous characters.  He can ooze around, shapeshift, and pretty much whatever else he likes.  Loads of fun to animate.  Enjoy!  Note that he comes both in pinapple (the green is a clever disguise) and delicious mercury flavors.
