Hello everyone,

As you may know, I've been doing characters for Ultimate Smash friends.  As you may not know, one of the ones that I made a game attempt at was OpenGameArt.org's own signature mascot, Sara.  Somehow, this character never quite gelled in my first attempts; the products of this work can be seen below.  I'll be making another attempt at some point in the future to get her properly defined and sprited up!  In th emean time, these strange WiP shots might be useful for something, or at least be interesting as curiosities.

From left to right:
