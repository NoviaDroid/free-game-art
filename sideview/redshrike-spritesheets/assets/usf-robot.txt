After a rather drawn-out process of creation, this robot is finally seeing the light of day.  I actually started him quite a long time ago; he was designed in my first phase of work, right alongside the Awesome Possum.  Anyway, I'm very glad to finally get it finished and posted.  Notes: he is apparently an artifact of another civilization; despite his damage he is a formidible foe, with unequalled strength and capable of moving quickly when least expected.
