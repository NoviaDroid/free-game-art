This is Sorlo, a character whose concept was created by doudoulolita, an artist who made some characters for Ultimate Smash Friends.  There has been something of a style shift in the mainline version, but I really liked the idea of the character, so I thought that it would be good to make another version of the character.  It was a lot of fun to do, though it took longer than I thought to make the various effects.  He could also be useful in any sort of fighting game or whatever else you care to make.

Note that he comes both in Sorlo the Blue and powered-up Sorlo the Red with Gold Trim versions.
