Yo!  I had the idea to do this soon after I finished the 10 rpg enemy set a while ago, but it took a long time to put together between other projects and such.  Fortunately, this is the sort of thing I can work on when I'm tired and frustrated.  Anyway, this was sort of a unique challenge for me: I wanted them to be immediately recognizable as goblins, but not to be at least marginally different from the purely steriotypical version.  As such I tried to depict them as a little more civilized and organized than they often are.  And stuff.

So, yeah.  If you do use them (please do), I would very much appreciate you dropping me a line here because I'm going to want to see it.
