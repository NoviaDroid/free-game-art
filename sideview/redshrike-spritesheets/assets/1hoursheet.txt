I haven't been able to post much art here recently--I've been pretty busy with my studies and with commissions.  I really liked this challenge--a few years back there was a 15 minute challenge, and this seemed like a good way to gauge how far I'd come with quick composition.  I've been wanting to do more LPC stuff, so doing an LPC-styled monster seemed like a good idea.  I managed to get a flying animation in but that was it.  I may come back and do some more later.
