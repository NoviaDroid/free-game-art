Hey all,

This is my entry to the "Eternal Ice" challenge.  I had more ambitious plans for a fuller set of ice enemies, but...first week of school, etc etc et al. misc bbq.

I may come back at some point and add more variations: various gem recolors/reworks, stone, etc.  Or maybe someone else will?  Who knows.

Fire and Dark variations are by Mumu
Ice variation is by artisticdude
