This is Xeon, some sort of power-suit wearing person/alien, done for Ultimate Smash Friends, a very cool-looking super smash brothers clone.  It could also work for any sort of fighting game, or maybe a platformer.  Note that he comes both in normal lemon-strawberry and powered-up licoriche flavors.

Edit: Added a concept-art piece I did when I was bored.
