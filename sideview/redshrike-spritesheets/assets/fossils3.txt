More RPG enemies!  This time I focused on fossils, because fossils are cool.  Actually, someone suggested I draw a wolf, and it ended up as the fossil T-Rex(ish) skeleton, so I made the others to match.  Pictured are, from left to right:

A T-Rex/Generic Therapsid

A Trilobite

A Cyclops/Giant (note: the skull is based off of dwarf mammoth skulls which may have formed a basis of the myth of the cyclops)

A crocodile/alligator/gavial/ghariel.

A pterodactyl.
