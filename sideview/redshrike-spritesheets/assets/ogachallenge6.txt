Here's my entry for this latest challenge: three RPG enemies for my ongoing set (http://opengameart.org/content/sideview-pixel-art-rpg-enemy-sprites) based on preexisting works.

The Anglerman and Dirg are based off of these concept works by 5hiroi: http://opengameart.org/content/the-angler-man and http://opengameart.org/content/a-dirg

The Naga is based off of this sprite by Heather Lee Harvey (aka Emerald) : http://opengameart.org/content/loyalty-lies-monsters-earth-monster-04
