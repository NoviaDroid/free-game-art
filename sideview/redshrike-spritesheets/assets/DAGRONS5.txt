This is something I've wanted to do for a while: a set of dragons for the ongoing rpg enemy set that's been building up.  And it's finally done, after a half year of occasional prodding at it, and with the help of five of our finest contributors who were kind enough to help!  Included are 9 10 11 dragons: 6 7 brand new, 2 3 remixes of previous content and the tiny green dragon from my 10 rpg enemy set who got it all started.

The ancient dragon is based on a PD dragon concept by Surt, which is available here:  http://opengameart.org/forumtopic/cc0-scraps and was pixelled by Redshrike.

The juevenile dragon is also based on Surt's concept, and was pixelled by Zabin.

The red scaly dragon is (lightly) edited by Redshrike from a work by Blarumyrran, available here: http://opengameart.org/content/dragons

The large green dragon is by Blarumyrran.

The red dragon with small wings is by MrBeast.

The blue, winged dragon by Sharm.

Note: we may be getting a contribution from Charles Gabriel as well, so stay tuned!

These are labelled in one of the files.

These enemies are a part of the ongoing rpg enemy project, available here: http://opengameart.org/content/sideview-pixel-art-rpg-enemy-sprites
