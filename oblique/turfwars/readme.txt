A long time ago I commissioned some pixel art for a project of mine called TurfWars. It has since become a 3D game so I thought I'd make the tile set available.

It's only a small set, but it should be enough to drive a small game or some concept work. All up there are 9 buildings (not all shown in preview), as well as several road variations.
