NOTE: some of these sprites are edits of other freedoom sprites by other artists. But Raymoohawk's edits are amazing, improving quality and design of original art by several orders of magnitude.

If you want to use these sprites credit Raymoohawk, freedoom project, and other artists:
- Urric (did original cyber concept)
- saint_of_killers (original Zombie)
- Maz Hades (zamanthyte tube)
