Some dark fantasy themed item sprites intended for a sprite-based FPS.  I initially made them for a predecessor project to Blasphemer that was never announced or released; some of them made their way into Blasphemer in modified form but others had no place to fit there.

This is for the most part OLD work and probably not up to par with what I can do nowadays, but hopefully some of these will be useful to someone even if they need a touch of tweaking.

I'm offering them up as CC0, so do an ye will.
