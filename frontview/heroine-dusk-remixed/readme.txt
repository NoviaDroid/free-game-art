It's no secret, I'm a fan of Clint Bellanger's Heroine Duskâ„¢.  A while ago I made remixed versions of the monsters, but the titular heroine had been left undone.  I actually did have an attempt at editing the original sprite at one point, but somehow I couldn't get her charm to carry over with my changes.  So for this one I started from scratch.  She has 6 different armors and 6 weapons, just as the original sprite does.  Like the other sprites, she is drawn with the dawnbringer 16 color palette.

Edit (2/26/2015): Made some updates to the base, changed the paperdoll components to fit.  Hope to expand this someday, but since it hasn't been used since I uploaded it as far as I can tell I can't prioritize it like I'd like to.
