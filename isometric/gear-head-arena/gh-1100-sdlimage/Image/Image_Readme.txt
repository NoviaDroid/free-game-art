Alternate Tileset for GearHead 1

Installation Instructions
*************************

Disclaimer!!!
I claim no liability or responsibility for damages or loss 
resulting from the usage or installation of this archive.

Make a backup copy of your GearHead directory, as you will be 
altering and removing files as a part of the installation 
process. Change to the GearHead directory and delete or rename 
the Image directory. Then, extract this archive and copy the 
Image directory to the GearHead directory.

I've converted all .BMP images to .PNG format, so any files 
referencing the old images will need to be updated to reflect 
this. You'll need to use a text search-and-replace utility to 
scan all files within the GearHead directory (including 
"arena.exe" and "cosplay.exe") for the string ".png" (without 
quotes) and replace it with the string ".png" (without quotes).

Note: there's a patch in the Files section of the GearHead 
Yahoo! Group that is supposed to make all the necessary changes 
to the GearHead files (except for savegames, I'm guessing). I 
haven't tried it, myself.


New in version 1.4
******************

* Re-rendered some monsters and character sprites.
* Reduced color-depth of palette-swap sprites to 256 colors 
  using a custom palette. (The custom palette can be downloaded 
  from the Files > Graphics section of the Yahoo! group.)
* Fixed the smoke sprite.
* New background behind portraits.
* Drones now appear a bit smaller than they did before.


New in version 1.3
******************

* New tileset has enhanced edges.
* New renders featuring a different lighting scheme than before.
* Trees are textured and spaced apart better.
* Water is textured.
* Replaced some interface sprites.
* New flame and smoke sprites.


New in version 1.2
******************

* All images have been 'crushed' using a utility called 
  PNGCRUSH.
* Added the new portraits and monster sprites from GH1 v1.000.
* Tweaked most of the portraits again.
* Moved all images that weren't being used in GH to a separate 
  archive (also available from my website). This includes the 
  new road and city tiles and the weapon effects.
* The new meta-terrain sprites (e.g., the zigguraut and 
  generator) have been added to 'meta_terrain.png', though 
  they're still unused by the game, currently.
* The hill sprites have been rerendered using anti-aliasing and 
  alpha transparency.
* I created a new fire sprite in 'meta_terrain.png'. It still 
  needs some work, as the stipple transparency doesn't look so 
  good when placed behind a smoke sprite. Also, it seems to be 
  rendered to the screen twice (once on top of another) for 
  some reason. This was also true in previous versions of 
  GearHead.
* Changed the city sprite in 'meta_terrain.png' to a shorter 
  variant.
* Remade the boulder sprite in 'meta_terrain.png'.


New in version 1.18
*******************

* I've created a new set of building tiles for use in city 
  scenes.
* I've added new backdrops to "backdrops.png".
* I've created new weapon and explosion sprites.
* I've converted all images to 32-bit PNG with transparency.
* I added transparency masks to all images.
* I changed "wall_stone.png" to a sloping wall.
* I changed the floor tile used for corporate buildings.
* I updated the Zigguraut sprite in "extras.png" updated. It's 
  now slightly larger.
* Many sprites have been updated to use the newer lighting 
  scheme.
* I replaced the world-map town sprites with new images based 
  on the city tile set.
* I created two new sets of street tiles -- one for the world 
  map and one for the mecha scale factor.
