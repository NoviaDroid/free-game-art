"These were handmade with a minimal palette with nothing but paint. I harvested parts of my style and about half of the palette from Yar's most excellent free isometric tileset.

Everything, however, was drawn by hand from scratch. (Which wouldn't be necessary to mention if it weren't this community.)"
