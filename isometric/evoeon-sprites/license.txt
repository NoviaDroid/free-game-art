30+ rendered environment sprites. Originally created for an isometric game. Includes 14 sprite sheets. Most objects have 8 directions.

Two isometric rendered homes with 8 directions each. (16 PNG Files)

19 Rendered Characters (Static Images), and 7 Rendered Items. These were made for an old cancelled casual game project of mine.

Enjoy.
