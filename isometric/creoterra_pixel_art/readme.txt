With my last post it seemed like there might be a little interest in giving some free pixel art characters for people to use so I got everything ready and packed up. The package includes the individual png sprite frames, the .gal (graphics gale) files, and the two full character sheets. It includes ten characters with the humans nearly complete and the undead needing some additional work. 

(note: you can easily select the magenta portions in the palette and color them how you want, or do it dynamically in-game by checking for R==B&&G==0 and multiplying that value by the team colour, etc)

Feel free to use them for anything you want as they are under a "do whatever you want with them" license... so either internal pre-production / stand-in artwork or for commercial use. As I mentioned in the last post I'd much rather have somebody use them instead of rotting away on our company backup server after burning capital on their production.
