Released on www.yoannsculo.fr/publication-des-images-de-simerion-en-creative-commons-by

This archive holds images from the web browser video game I made with friends
between 2005 and 2009, called Simerion. We used to find the game at the following urls:

	www.simerion.fr	/ www.simerion.com

The game will close / has closed in July 2012. But you can still find some
information on my website here:

I thought it would be so sad to loose all those images and tiles I made back in
the day when I was young and fool :D !

So I decided to release them under Creative Commons Licenses (see below)

I hope my images will have a second life in future video games.
Just mention my work if you use it, and I would even be glad to know they live again !

I made most of the tiles myself. However other people helped me to create some
images here. Yet I got their autorization to publish them. *If* I ever made any
mistake releasing images which are not my own work, please contact me.

Enjoy !
