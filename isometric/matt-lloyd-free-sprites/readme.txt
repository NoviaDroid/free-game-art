Originally these sprites were released in 2011 at
http://www.shiva-engine.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=30&t=22259
http://forum.thegamecreators.com/?m=forum_view&t=181600&b=4

In 2015 I've submitted them to OGA, gaining confirmation for Matt, that they are indeed public domain.

They were hosted at http://opengameart.org/content/matt-lloyds-isometric-fantasy-sprites until I got banned due to controversial discussion about opengameart.org's politics, ethics and target audiency (http://opengameart.org/forumtopic/censored-broforce-sprites-and-game-ready)
