These high quality graphics assets came from the former "Novus Dawn" project and licensed under CC3-BY-SA.

I, Nikita Sadkov, have purchased them from Matthew Ostil on March 3, 2015 and now release them under CC3-BY-SA license.

If used, prodvide link to https://github.com/saniv and mention in your game's credits, that these assets came from my indie game "The Spell of Mastery". You should also give credit to Matthew Ostil, who produced these quality graphics and generously provided under a fair price. It would be nice if you also credit Tim Jonsson - original artist.

Your donations will be used to finish "The Spell of Mastery" game and produce more free to use assets.
