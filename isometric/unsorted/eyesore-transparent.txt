I've removed the background, so the these sprites can be easily used ingame

As a bonus I've converted two bush sprites and the chest sprit to Yar's tileset format.

While Surt says that "None of this was meant to be anything but rough concepts", a lot of open source games use even more rough stuff (think of Crossfire). And these sprites are detailed enough for most uses.
