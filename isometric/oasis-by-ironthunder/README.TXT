I had this built when I was working on a anime chess game.  Cancelled the project and decided to do a JRPG instead.  I'm giving this build to community because I have no use for it as a whole because of the angle of the assets.  You guys can use commercially I just ask that you please give me credit for giving it to you and please support my new title by checking it out at http://www.indiedb.com/games/mystic-tales-legend-of-the-janovi-gem
