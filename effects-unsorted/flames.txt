Flames extracted from Sharm's LPC Fireplace

http://opengameart.org/content/lpc-fireplace

Packed as 16x24 pixel frames for easy indexing. They are not finely adjusted to always sit on the same base but I didn't want to mess with it endlessly. They're reasonably close though. Figured it was useful enough as-is if anyone was interested.

Archive includes flame sheet, individual frames, and animated gif. All images have transparent background.
