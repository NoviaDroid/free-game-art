Here is a cool shield effect i made in GIMP. This is how it looks in my game. It shows itself when a ship is being attacked, signaling that the shield is protecting it (as long as its energy is sufficient). It's kind of an energy field.

Maybe i will improve it further, but for now it's ok enough to be uploaded. Or better to say: I haven't changed it for 2 weeks, so fuck it. (:

Before someone asks: No, i don't have the GIMP file anymore. I never saved it somehow.
