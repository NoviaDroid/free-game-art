I took Surt's Town Tiles and combined them with Redshrike's RPG Indoor Tileset Expansion 1, added a bit of my own stuff and edited it all together.  I added the beginnings of a castle tileset as well, but it will only work with some creative thinking and lots of layers ATM.  I've only included the tiles that I edited, so to map something that looks like the previews you'll need to download the other sets as well.
