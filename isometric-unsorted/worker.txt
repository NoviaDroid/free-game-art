I crafted these pixel workers for a game that was never finished. There are walking, dying and "working on something" poses / animations.

The sprites are very basic, I guess they could use some improvement. But they might be a nice start as there are 4 sets (default, with mask, with hat, with hat&mask) and all of them are drawn for all 4 directions. You'd have to isolate the different sprites manually, as they don't ship layered but on a simple PNG. Also, you can recolor them easily.
