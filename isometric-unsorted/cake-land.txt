Was inspired by some artwork I saw on DeviantArt, started doodling in GIMP...and this is where I ended up.

There should be enough here to make a weird little game and the art is simple enough so that colouring or adding stuff should be easy.

Updated - Little bit of clean up, added some rooms and a sad little dude and his sad dog.

Updated again: More stuff added. More rooms, buildings, characters and items and a rough spritesheet for the sad dude.
