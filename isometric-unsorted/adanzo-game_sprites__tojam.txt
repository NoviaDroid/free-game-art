Again, these have been submitted on deviantart before, but now you can see them all at the same time! yay!

These are some game sprites (3D made 2D) for an isometric and top-down game. The brown mouse was meant to run around an isometric maze, gathering cheese faster than his rival, the black rat, while avoiding the enemy cat. The ship was made for a straightforward shooting game, but was canceled before it started, due to not being original enough
