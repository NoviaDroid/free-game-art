A tutorial on how to make front view version, given isometric one.

Front view can be helpful if you want to make a 3d model out of isometric spirte or just want a few more directions.

Vivisection Steps:

0. find a character sprite (this example uses http://opengameart.org/content/isometric-faun)

1. separate body from head
2. cut the half of body closest to viewer (leftmost on the example)
3. make a smart object out of it, duplicate it and mirror the duplicated version, putting it beside the original half.
4. now edit the smart object to reduce the width ot resulting body sprite and mirror parts requiring mirroring.
5. repeat steps 2-4 for head, then attach head to body

Note: unfortunately GIMP doesn't have smart objects, so you'll likely have to get Photoshop somehow, otherwise doing step 3 would be a little hard.
